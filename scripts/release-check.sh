  cat <<'USAGE'
Usage: release-check.sh [--no-build] [--help]

Runs the same build + smoke + scan stages dev-release.yml runs, with push disabled.
Intended for fast local feedback before pushing a tag.

Flags:
  --no-build   Skip the docker build step (just report what would run).
  --help       Show this help.

Stages simulated:
  1. build      buildx --load (single-arch, host's native).
  2. smoke      run the resulting seta-server image with `health` subcommand.
  3. scan       Trivy on seta-server, fail on HIGH/CRITICAL.

Push is always skip-push in this script. CI is the only thing allowed to push.
