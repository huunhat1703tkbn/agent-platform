/**
 * A small per-process LRU+TTL cache for embedded queries. JavaScript's Map preserves
 * insertion order, so LRU is implemented by deleting and reinserting on access —
 * the most-recently-used entry ends at the back of the iteration order, and the
 * oldest sits at the front for eviction.
 *
 * Not thread-safe across processes — one provider call per (model, query) per
 * process per TTL window is the budget.
 *
 * Key separator is a space. Model IDs follow `provider:variant` convention and
 * cannot contain spaces, so collisions are not possible in practice.
 *
 * Concurrent get() calls for the same missing key will each fire compute() —
 * in-flight deduplication is out of scope for this slice.
